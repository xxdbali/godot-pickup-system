# Godot FPS Pickup System with Inventory & Save/Load Manager

This project is a modular FPS-style object pickup system built in **Godot**, enhanced with an **inventory manager** and a **node store** for handling save/load functionality. It's ideal for first-person games that require dynamic interaction with objects, real-time inventory control, and persistent world state.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **FPS Object Pickup System**
  - Raycast-based interaction
  - Works with physics-based or static scene nodes

- **Inventory System**
  - Add/remove items dynamically
  - Item metadata support (e.g., type, quantity, custom ID)
  - Slot management and visual feedback integration

- **Node Store & State Manager**
  - Saves picked-up object data (position, state, ID)
  - Restores objects from inventory back into the scene
  - Handles loading and saving the entire game state

- **Modular and Extensible**
  - Drop-in ready for new or existing Godot FPS projects
  - Easy to customize item behaviors and inventory logic

## ðŸ§© Use Cases

- First-person adventure or survival games
- Puzzle games where objects are picked and used later
- Inventory-heavy games needing scene persistence
- Prototypes that evolve into full save/load-capable projects
